// Shared by both sides, and by nothing else. Plain C so the forwarder stays a
// C-ABI library with no dependency on the sidecar's C++ headers, and so the
// host resolves every entry point by name with GetProcAddress rather than
// linking an import library that would tie the two binaries' versions together
// silently. sidecar_nr_abi_version() is the check that they agree.
//
// NGX results are returned as int: 1 is NVSDK_NGX_Result_Success, anything
// with the high bit set is an NVSDK_NGX_Result failure code, and the small
// negative numbers below are the forwarder's own -- distinguishable from NGX's
// because NGX never returns a value in that range.
